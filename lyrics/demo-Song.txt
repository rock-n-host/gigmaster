
[Verse]
I’m typing out my code tonight,
Blue and green lines looking right,
Commit the change, I feel the buzz—
Time to push it to the Hub!

[Chorus]
Oh GitHub, GitHub,
Where all my branches grow,
Merge my dreams together
In a perfect workflow.
Oh GitHub, GitHub,
You keep my bugs at bay—
I push, you pull, we sync,
And ship the code away!
